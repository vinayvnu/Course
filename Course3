Pawan Dubey
Dynamic Programming
Understanding the prolem and implementing a solution which is space and time efficient by structuring it into sub problems.

Vinay Thakur
Divide and Conquer Algorithms
its better to make code in smaller chunks or functions instead of writing the whole solution one function.
This will make the code diffcult to understand and difficult to debug.
